# nuclei ssrf template
Nuclei Template: SSRF Variations

Description:
This template is specifically crafted to detect SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) vulnerabilities with different attack variations. SSRF is a security vulnerability where an attacker can manipulate the server to make requests to internal or external resources without the user's knowledge.

Main Focus:

Variations:

The template covers a wide range of SSRF attack variations to identify vulnerabilities in various scenarios.
Each variation is designed to test the limitations and filters applied to input URLs or related parameters.
Vulnerability Identification:

The goal of this template is to assist companies and security researchers in identifying SSRF in their web applications.
Severity Level:

The template includes attack variations with different severity levels, ranging from medium to critical, allowing companies to address vulnerabilities based on priority.
Special Header Testing:

Some attack variations may test whether the server allows or blocks special headers such as X-BUG-BOUNTY to identify SSRF potentially associated with bug bounty programs.
How to Use:
1. Install Nuclei:

    Make sure you have Nuclei installed on your system.
    
    bash
    Copy code
    go get -u github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/v2/cmd/nuclei
    Use the Template:

2. Run Nuclei with the SSRF Variations template.

    bash
    Copy code
    nuclei -target target.txt -t ssrf-variations.yaml

3. Result Analysis:

    Analyze the output to identify SSRF vulnerabilities and determine necessary actions.
   
This template can be widely used to test web applications for SSRF vulnerabilities and help enhance system security.
